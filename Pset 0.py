#Just as an aside
#You could also rewrite the above in Python as:
print("The log of 2 base two is: ", math.log2(2))
print("")

#You could also use numpy to find the log:
print("The log of 2 base two is: ", np.log2(2))
print("")

#The log functions however, return the output as floats, so you could convert to integer
print("The log of 2 base two (in integer) is: ", int(math.log2(2)))
